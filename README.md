# Project7-face-recognition

Face recognition is a biometric technology for identification based on the information of human facial features. A series of related technologies that use a camera to capture an image or video stream containing a human face, automatically detect and track the face in the image, and then perform face recognition on the detected face, are often also called portrait recognition or facial recognition. This project is implemented in Python.
